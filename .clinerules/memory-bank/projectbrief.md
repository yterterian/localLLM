This file defines the core requirements, goals, and scope of the project.  
It is the foundation for all other memory bank files.

## Project Name:
Local LLM System with Intelligent Routing and Context Expansion

## Core Requirements:
- Intelligent routing between three specialized local models (Qwen3 30B-A3B, Qwen2.5 Coder 32B, Llama 4 16x17B)
- Cline memory bank awareness and integration
- VSCode + Cline workflow optimization
- Vector store-based context expansion for unlimited codebase understanding
- OpenAI-compatible API for seamless integration
- Professional project structure with proper environment management
- Real-time model switching based on task complexity and type
- Memory bank content injection for enhanced context

## Goals:
- Create a local AI development assistant that rivals cloud-based solutions
- Optimize specifically for Cline's memory bank workflow patterns
- Maximize utilization of RTX 5080 + 128GB RAM hardware setup
- Provide intelligent model selection based on task type (memory reading, implementation, analysis)
- Enable unlimited context through vector store integration
- Maintain complete privacy and control over all data and models
- Support multiple coding workflows: implementation, debugging, refactoring, analysis
- Create a foundation for future agentic workflows and Home Assistant integration

## Scope:
### In Scope:
- Three-model intelligent routing system
- Cline memory bank detection and integration
- Vector store management (Chroma, FAISS, Qdrant options)
- FastAPI-based router with OpenAI compatibility
- VSCode task integration and monitoring
- Professional project structure with automated setup scripts
- Context expansion for large codebases
- Session tracking and continuity
- Health monitoring and performance optimization

### Out of Scope (Future Phases):
- Home Assistant integration (Phase 2)
- Advanced agentic workflows (Phase 3)
- Multi-user support
- Distributed deployment
- Web UI for management
- Fine-tuning capabilities

## Success Criteria:
- Sub-5 second responses for memory bank reading (Qwen3)
- Sub-45 second responses for complex coding tasks (Qwen2.5 Coder)
- Comprehensive analysis in under 3 minutes (Llama 4)
- Seamless Cline integration with automatic model selection
- 99%+ uptime for local development work
- Efficient memory usage (under 120GB total)
- Vector store search under 2 seconds for most queries

## Notes:
- Designed specifically for Python 3.13.5 environment
- Optimized for RTX 5080 GPU with 16GB VRAM
- Assumes 128GB DDR5-6400 system RAM
- Models chosen for complementary capabilities: MoE efficiency (Qwen3), coding specialization (Qwen2.5 Coder), massive context (Llama 4)
- Memory bank integration is critical for Cline workflow effectiveness
- System should serve as foundation for future AI development tool expansion
