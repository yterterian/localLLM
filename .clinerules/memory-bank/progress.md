This file tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, and known issues.

## What Works:
- Project folder structure and scripts for local LLM workflows are in place.
- Memory-aware router (src/cline/memory_aware_router.py) is integrated.
- Context expansion server and integration scripts are present.
- Core memory bank files are initialized.

## What's Left to Build:
- Implement model preloading and warm cache for faster response times.
- Integrate smart context injection and compression for relevant, efficient context.
- Optimize hardware utilization (GPU/RAM-aware model placement).
- Optimize vector store performance (hybrid FAISS/ChromaDB).
- Integrate ML-enhanced routing and real-time performance monitoring.
- Populate memory bank files with detailed project and technical information.
- Verify end-to-end system operation (router, context expansion, Ollama integration).
- Expand and document test coverage in the tests/ directory.
- Identify and document any known issues or gaps in implementation.

## Current Status:
- System structure and scripts are ready for local LLM workflows.
- Memory bank is initialized but not yet populated with project-specific content.
- Performance optimization roadmap established; immediate focus on model preloading, context injection, and hardware-aware placement.
- Reference implementations for optimization in `src/optimization/optimized_model_manager.py` and `src/optimization/intelligent_context_manager.py`.

## Known Issues:
- No known issues documented yet; further verification and testing required.

## Notes:
- Continue to align documentation and implementation as the project evolves.
- Expected gains: 30-60% faster response times, 40-60% better hardware utilization, and improved user experience with predictive model loading and smart context management.
