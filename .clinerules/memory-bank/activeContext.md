# activeContext.md

This file tracks the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps for the project.

## Current Work Focus:
- Integrating and initializing the Cline memory bank for this project.
- Ensuring the memory-aware router and context expansion server are operational.
- Aligning project folder structure with memory bank documentation.

## Recent Changes:
- Created all core memory bank files with template headers.
- Integrated the new memory-aware router (src/cline/memory_aware_router.py).
- Updated scripts/run_system.sh to launch the router and context expansion server.
- Established project intelligence file at .clinerules/project_intelligence.md.

## Next Steps:
- Populate memory bank files with detailed project and technical information.
- Verify end-to-end system operation (router, context expansion, Ollama integration).
- Expand and document test coverage in the tests/ directory.
- Identify and document any known issues or gaps in implementation.

## Active Decisions & Considerations:
- Using .clinerules as a directory for memory bank and project intelligence files.
- Prioritizing memory bank population and system verification before further feature development.

## Notes:
- The memory bank is initialized but not yet populated with project-specific content.
- System structure and scripts are in place for local LLM workflows.
