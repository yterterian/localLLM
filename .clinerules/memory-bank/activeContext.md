This file tracks the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps for the project.

## Current Work Focus:
- Integrating and initializing the Cline memory bank for this project.
- Ensuring the memory-aware router and context expansion server are operational.
- Aligning project folder structure with memory bank documentation.
- Prioritizing performance optimization: model preloading, smart context injection, and hardware-aware model placement.

## Recent Changes:
- Created all core memory bank files with template headers.
- Integrated the new memory-aware router (src/cline/memory_aware_router.py).
- Updated scripts/run_system.sh to launch the router and context expansion server.
- Established project intelligence file at .clinerules/project_intelligence.md.

## Next Steps:
- Implement model preloading and warm cache for faster response times.
- Integrate smart context injection and compression for relevant, efficient context.
- Optimize hardware utilization (GPU/RAM-aware model placement).
- Populate memory bank files with detailed project and technical information.
- Verify end-to-end system operation (router, context expansion, Ollama integration).
- Expand and document test coverage in the tests/ directory.
- Identify and document any known issues or gaps in implementation.

## Active Decisions & Considerations:
- Using .clinerules as a directory for memory bank and project intelligence files.
- Prioritizing memory bank population and system verification before further feature development.

## Notes:
- The memory bank is initialized but not yet populated with project-specific content.
- System structure and scripts are in place for local LLM workflows.

## Performance Optimization Roadmap (2025-06-16)

### Immediate Priorities (Phase 1)
- **Model Preloading & Warm Cache:** Implement predictive model loading and warmup for 30-50% faster response times.
- **Smart Context Injection:** Integrate intelligent context management for 25-35% faster processing and higher relevance.
- **Hardware-Aware Model Placement:** Dynamically allocate models to GPU/RAM for 40-60% better resource efficiency.

### Short-Term Priorities (Phase 2)
- **Vector Store Optimization:** Hybrid FAISS/ChromaDB for 50-70% faster context retrieval.
- **ML-Enhanced Routing:** Machine learning-based routing for 95%→98%+ accuracy.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time analytics and auto-optimization.

### Medium-Term (Phase 3)
- **Predictive Model Loading:** Anticipate user needs and preemptively load models.
- **Advanced Caching Strategies:** Session-aware and pattern-based caching.
- **Auto-Scaling Logic:** Dynamic resource allocation for future scaling.

### Expected Gains
- Memory Fast Model: 2-5s → 1-2s (50-60% improvement)
- Implementation Model: 15-45s → 8-25s (40-45% improvement)
- Analysis Model: 60-180s → 35-120s (40-35% improvement)
- Resource Efficiency: 40-60% better hardware utilization
- User Experience: Dramatically improved with predictive loading
